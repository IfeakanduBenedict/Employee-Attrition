# Employee-Attrition
Employee Attrition Analysis using Logistic Regression
This project explores and predicts employee attrition using logistic regression analysis. Leveraging an HR dataset comprising 14,999 employee records, the analysis includes comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), insightful visualizations, and a logistic regression model to predict whether an employee is likely to leave the organization.

Key Highlights:

Conducted thorough exploratory data analysis to identify key factors influencing employee turnover.

Implemented feature engineering techniques, including one-hot encoding for categorical variables.

Created impactful visualizations to illustrate critical insights, such as the correlation between salary levels and attrition rates.

Built and evaluated a logistic regression model, achieving accurate predictions validated through classification metrics.

Technologies Used:

Python

Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn (LogisticRegression, OneHotEncoder, train_test_split, accuracy_score)
